# univariatepolynomial Operation
data structures, DUT CS Course Data Structures and Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of a system for managing univariate polynomials. It allows for creating, manipulating, and evaluating polynomials using singly linked lists. The system can perform various operations like building a polynomial from input terms, adding two polynomials, and calculating the value of a polynomial for a given input.

### Features
1. **Create Polynomial**: Build a polynomial from user input with terms sorted in ascending order by exponent.
2. **Display Polynomial**: Output the polynomial in a human-readable format.
3. **Evaluate Polynomial**: Compute the value of the polynomial for a given variable input.
4. **Add Polynomials**: Sum two polynomials to create a new polynomial.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
